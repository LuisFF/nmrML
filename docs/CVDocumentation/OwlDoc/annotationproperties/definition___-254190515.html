http://purl.org/biotop/btl2.owl#<b>Function</b><span class='comment'> /*&nbsp;</span><span class='active-entity'>definition</span> <span class='literal'>"A classical definition of function according to Wright is that the function F of X is Z means that X is there because it Zs, and Z is a consequence of X being there. 

For artefacts, functions are distinguished from dispositions by the purpose they have been built. For example, a hammer has the function to drive in nails, but not to be used as a weapon. However, it has the disposition to be used as a weapon under certain circumstances.

For biological objects, which developed by evolution, the definition of function is still subject to controversy (e.g. Barry Smith's view of function as pertaining to a canonical life plan, cf. 
http://www.slideserve.com/presentation/103450/The-Canonical-Life). 

In BFO "Disposition" and "Function" are siblings, in BioTop Function is more specific.

Molecular entities can be isolated molecules or parts of molecules (groups, residue). They may be electrically neutral or not.

In biological systems molecular entities generally occur in very high quantities. In text, references to chemicals are often ambiguous. When we state "water has a molecular weight of 18" we refer to single water molecules. However, saying that "water has a density of 1kg/dm³" under certain conditions then we make a statement about pluralities of water molecules each of which has water molecules as "grains"
Old name: molecular entity

The upper bound of monomolecular entities is shallow. Strictly even a diamond crystal would be a monomolecular entity. One argument against this idea is that a diamond crystal is still a diamond crystal if you take away some portions.

A loss of some component affects the integrity of the compound, and possibly the type it instantiates, e.g. a complete vs. a defective organism. 

The choice of what is a component of a compound is somewhat arbitrary, because there are several ways to divide a whole into parts. Strictly spoken, this relation should refer to some partition.

Components should be - at least - partly bona fide parts. The use of this relation also requires the commitment to an underlying granularity level. So could we consider the codons (base triples) as the components of a DNA molecule but also the single nucleotides. Note that components of a compound may also be portions of matter.

http://purl.org/biotop/btl2.owl#<b>isComponentPartOf</b><span class='comment'> /*&nbsp;</span><span class='active-entity'>definition</span> <span class='literal'>"The non-transitive relation hasComponentPart (inverse: componentPartOf) relates components with a compound. Components strictly partition the compound, and the compound is the mereological sum of its components. A loss of some component affects the integrity of the compound, and possibly the type it instantiates, e.g. a complete vs. a defective organism. 

The choice of what is a component of a compound is somewhat arbitrary, because there are several ways to divide a whole into parts. Strictly spoken, this relation should refer to some partition.

Components should be - at least - partly bona fide parts. The use of this relation also requires the commitment to an underlying granularity level. So could we consider the codons (base triples) as the components of a DNA molecule but also the single nucleotides. Note that components of a compound may also be portions of matter.

Examples: my liver is a component of my organism, a carboxy group is a component of some organic acid molecule." <span style='color: black;'>()</span></span><span class='comment'>&nbsp;*/</span></li>
